> What it is
This app is able to display the song currently playing in your iTunes on Windows.
It will show the name of the song on the first line, and alternate between artist
of the song and the album + release date of the song on the second line.

> Where the code comes from ?
Please consider that I simply used an existing iTunes Bridge and used it for this app.
I don't own the full code.
